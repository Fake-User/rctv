### future-ish TODOs/open questions

- more rctogether API apps/api/calls/integrations?

- deployment to the raspi - can it be semiii automated? one idea from @megaserg that we almost ended up using on the [octopass raspi deployment](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/recurse-rfid-visits/) is to cron fetch from the github repo i.e. the pi auto-checks if there's a new release, picks it up, git pulls, and restarts the service

### extremely long term/maybe don't do this at all

- interactivity? sound? a webcam that can be turned on a little bit from time to time when folks by the television agree to it, etc.? (only while a button is being held down....??)
